## About The Project

A web platform where you can manage your own folders and files locally.

We have managed to simulate our own management cloud where you can access any folder you have.

You will access your folders once you have been able to register on the platform or have logged in.

<br>

### Built With

MyOwnDrive Front is developed with the following libraries and frameworks

* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)



## Getting Started

Next, we will show, step by step, the necessary configurations for the platform to work perfectly.

### Prerequisites

First of all you have to have installed the necessary packages and modules that are used in the application with the following command:


  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### Installation

Before starting the application, the server that manages all the platform information must be correctly configured. Next, we will link the repository where the server is so that it can be launched.

[Backend GitHub Repository](https://github.com/miguelCidPaz/my-drive)


### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
npm start 
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Purpose of the application

<p>A website that simulates a computer desktop where you can register and create folders where you can save your documents to later download them.</p>

## Features

<ul>
    <li>Day/Night mode</li>
    <li>Translation</li>
    <li>scrollable windows</li>
    <li>security token</li>
    <li>Create and delete folders that will contain files</li>
    <li>Upload and delete files</li>
</ul>


## Localized bugs and errors
<p>Bug in the handmade drag of the windows, the window jumps
when clicking on it and sometimes it leaves the screen.</p>
<p>Bug when downloading files, they cannot be downloaded although they can be viewed and downloaded
from that new window.</p>

## To do

<p>Fix bugs in the drag.</p>
<p>Solve file download to be able to do it directly from the front.</p>
<p>A search box to access any user file (it's already in the html but didn't have time to implement it).</p>
<p>More features for the TaskBar as a date control according to time zone to be able to change it.</p>
